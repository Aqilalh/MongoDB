# MongoDB

Mongo Db is a nosql databse which means we dont use sql commands to interact with it.
Mongodb uses collections and documents.
Each collection in a nosql database would store a specific type of data record like users authors or books. The records inside the collections are called documents.
If you used to javascript this would be easier to use because documents in mongodb are very much like json or javascript.
It also allows you to store nested documets within a documnet.
